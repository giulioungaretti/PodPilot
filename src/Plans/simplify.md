MinimalCLI shows a clear, straightforward pattern: enumerate paired AirPods, get connection/audio status, and connect/disconnect using `Win32BluetoothConnector`. Now reading the existing services in Services and Services to map overlaps and redundancies.

# 🔍 Comprehensive Review: Existing Services vs. Proposed Plan

## Current Architecture Inventory

### DeviceCommunication/Services (Core Layer)
| Service | Interface | Purpose | Event-Driven? | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| `AirPodsStateService` | `IAirPodsStateService` | **Unified state aggregator** – combines paired device + BLE data | ✅ Yes | Already does correlation via `ProductId`. This is the hub. |
| `BleDataProvider` | `IBleDataProvider` | Parses BLE advertisements → `BleEnrichmentData` | ✅ Yes | Lean, event-based, correctly scoped. |
| `PairedDeviceWatcher` | `IPairedDeviceWatcher` | Watches Windows `DeviceWatcher` for paired device changes | ✅ Yes | Event-based, no polling. |
| `PairedDeviceLookupService` | `IPairedDeviceLookupService` | Cached lookup by ProductId | ❌ Polling-style cache | **Redundant** – `PairedDeviceWatcher` already maintains live state. |
| `SimpleAirPodsDiscoveryService` | `IAirPodsDiscoveryService` | BLE discovery + paired lookup | ❌ Mixed | **Redundant** – duplicates `BleDataProvider` + `PairedDeviceLookupService`. |
| `BluetoothConnectionService` | `IBluetoothConnectionService` | Connect/disconnect by device ID | N/A (command) | Wraps `Win32BluetoothConnector`. Keep. |
| `Win32BluetoothConnector` | (none) | Low-level Win32 P/Invoke for audio profiles | N/A | Keep – required for connect/disconnect. |
| `DefaultAudioOutputMonitorService` | `IDefaultAudioOutputMonitorService` | Monitors default audio output changes | ✅ Yes | Event-based via `MediaDevice.DefaultAudioRenderDeviceChanged`. |
| `EarDetectionService` | (none) | Auto-pause/resume on ear removal | ✅ Yes | Consumes `IAirPodsStateService`. Keep. |
| `GlobalMediaController` | `IGlobalMediaController` | Pause/play system media | N/A (command) | Keep. |
| `BluetoothDeviceHelper` | (none) | Utility helpers | N/A | Needs review. |
| `AirPodsDeviceAggregator` | (none) | **Empty file** | N/A | Remove. |

### GUI/Services (UI Layer)
| Service | Interface | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| `DeviceStateManager` | `IDeviceStateManager` | Wraps `IAirPodsStateService`, marshals to UI thread | Thin wrapper – keeps UI decoupled from core. Keep. |
| `BackgroundDeviceMonitoringService` | `IBackgroundDeviceMonitoringService` | Tracks notification state per device | Consumes `IDeviceStateManager`. Keep. |
| `TrayIconService` | (none) | System tray | Keep. |

### Models (DeviceCommunication/Models)
| Model | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `PairedDeviceInfo` | Paired device record from Windows | Minimal, correct. |
| `AirPodsDeviceInfo` | BLE-centric discovery record | **Overlaps** with `AirPodsState`. Candidate for removal. |
| `AirPodsState` | Unified state (paired + BLE) | Authoritative projection. Keep and extend. |
| `BleEnrichmentData` | BLE-only enrichment DTO | Clean, scoped. Keep. |

## Key Findings

### ✅ What's Already Good
1. **`AirPodsStateService`** is already the correlation hub – it subscribes to `IPairedDeviceWatcher` and `IBleDataProvider`, merges by `ProductId`, and emits `StateChanged` events.
2. **`BleDataProvider`** is clean and event-driven.
3. **`PairedDeviceWatcher`** uses Windows `DeviceWatcher` events (no polling).
4. **`DefaultAudioOutputMonitorService`** uses `MediaDevice.DefaultAudioRenderDeviceChanged` (event-based).
5. **`EarDetectionService`** consumes unified state and controls media.
6. **GUI layer** correctly wraps core services and marshals to UI thread.

### ⚠️ Redundancies & Overlaps
1. **`SimpleAirPodsDiscoveryService`** duplicates `BleDataProvider` + `PairedDeviceLookupService`. Used by nothing in the main path. **Remove.**
2. **`PairedDeviceLookupService`** is a cache-based lookup that duplicates `PairedDeviceWatcher.GetByProductId()`. **Remove.**
3. **`IAirPodsDiscoveryService`** interface is unused by the main flow. **Remove.**
4. **`AirPodsDeviceInfo`** model overlaps with `AirPodsState`. **Consolidate or remove.**
5. **`AirPodsDeviceAggregator.cs`** is empty. **Remove.**
6. **`BluetoothConnectionService`** wraps `Win32BluetoothConnector` but adds little value (caches `BluetoothDevice` references). Consider inlining into `IAudioControlService` or keeping as-is.

### 🔧 Missing Pieces (from plan)
1. **`IAudioControlService`** interface – currently `BluetoothConnectionService` + `Win32BluetoothConnector` serve this role but lack a clean interface for mocking.
2. **`IAudioPolicyProvider`** – ear removal policy is hardcoded in `EarDetectionService`. Should be configurable.
3. **Audio route fallback** – when disconnecting, no logic to revert to previous default output.

## Revised Plan

### Phase 1: Cleanup (Remove Redundancies)
| Action | File(s) |
|--------|---------|
| Delete | SimpleAirPodsDiscoveryService.cs, `IAirPodsDiscoveryService.cs` |
| Delete | PairedDeviceLookupService.cs, `IPairedDeviceLookupService.cs` |
| Delete | `AirPodsDeviceAggregator.cs` (empty) |
| Delete | AirPodsDeviceInfo.cs (use `AirPodsState` everywhere) |
| Update | Remove usages of deleted types from remaining code |

### Phase 2: Interface Alignment
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Create | `IAudioControlService` interface exposing `ConnectAsync`, `DisconnectAsync`, `IsDefaultAudioOutputAsync` |
| Implement | `AudioControlService` wrapping `Win32BluetoothConnector` (or rename `BluetoothConnectionService`) |
| Create | `IAudioPolicyProvider` interface with `AutoPausePolicy` enum (`Disabled`, `OneRemoved`, `BothRemoved`) |
| Implement | `AudioPolicyProvider` with default config; wire into `EarDetectionService` |

### Phase 3: State Service Refinement
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Extend | `AirPodsState` with `PreviousAudioOutputId` for route fallback |
| Add | Optional debounce in `BleDataProvider` (currently debounce is in `DeviceStateManager`) – consider moving to core |
| Add | Structured logging via `ILogger<T>` injection (optional) |

### Phase 4: DI Registration
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Update | CLI Program.cs to register services via DI (currently uses `new`) |
| Ensure | GUI `App.xaml.cs` registers all interfaces for testability |
| Create | Test doubles / mocks for `IBleDataProvider`, `IPairedDeviceWatcher`, `IAudioControlService` |

### Phase 5: Testing
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Add | Unit tests for `AirPodsStateService` correlation logic |
| Add | Integration tests with fake BLE/paired event sequences |
| Validate | MinimalCLI works with refactored services |
